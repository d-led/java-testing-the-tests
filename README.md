Chasing high line or even branch coverage is not the whole picture.

The quality lies in the expectations and assumptions of the people involved.

The assumptions and the explicit expectations are further verified via Property-Based Testing & Mutation Testing.

It's about **testing the tests**.

The system under test is a simple function:

```java
int sumOf(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

and the test that would give a 100% coverage:

```java
@Test void summation() {
    // how hard can 2+2 be?
    assertThat(maths.sumOf(2, 2))
        .isEqualTo(4)
    ;
}
```

Yet in this simple example, with a 100% coverage *easily* attainable, the expected qualities may be insufficient.

## Mutation Testing

> How hard is it to test 2+2 (addition)?

Testing the quality of test via mutation testing: https://pitest.org

```bash
gradle pitest
```

or

```bash
./gradlew pitest
```

&darr;

test `2 + 2 == 4`:

open [`app/build/reports/pitest/com.siemens.code.dled/index.html`](app/build/reports/pitest/com.siemens.code.dled/index.html)

![mutation coverage by class](doc/img/coverage_1.png)

![the uncovered line](doc/img/maths_1.png))

the line coverage is perfect, yet mutations hint at inputs not verified: `2*2==4`

Adding one more test: `2+4=6` fills the coverage gap:

&darr;

![multiplication substituted](doc/img/coverage_2.png)

![coverage 100%](doc/img/maths_2.png))

comment out the second test in [MathsTest.java](app/src/test/java/com/siemens/code/dled/MathsTest.java) to see the mutation coverage drop.

## Property-Based Testing

> Are you sure, programming and eliminating bugs is that simple?

Testing the assumptions about code: https://jqwik.net

```java
boolean hypothesis_sum_of_two_positive_numbers_is_positive(
  @ForAll("positive") int a,
  @ForAll("positive") int b
) {
  return maths.sumOf(a, b) > 0;
}
```

(such assumptions [can be fatal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_overflow#Examples))

&darr;

```bash
gradle test --rerun-tasks --info
```

&darr;
